    <h1 class="title">POKEMON</h1>
    <p class="poke">
        Pokémon, electronic game series from Nintendo that debuted in Japan in
        February 1996 as Pokémon Green and Pokémon Red. The franchise later became
        wildly popular in the United States and around the world. The series,
        originally produced for the company’s Game Boy line of handheld consoles,
        was introduced in 1998 to the United States with two titles, known to fans
        as Red and Blue. In the games, players assume the role of Pokémon
        trainers, obtaining cartoon monsters and developing them to battle other
        Pokémon. Pokémon became one of the most successful video game franchises
        in the world, second only to Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros.

    <h2>Charizard</h2>
    <p>
        Charizard (known as Lizardon in Japan) is a character of the Pokémon anime
        and video game series. Ash, one of the main characters in the series, owns
        a Charizard. Known as the Flame Pokémon, Charizards are violent yet
        honorable creatures, flying proudly around the sky and always looking for
        powerful enemies to fight with. Charizard is also the version mascot of
        Pokémon Red and FireRed versions, and makes an appearance on the boxarts
        of many other Pokémon games. During an interview, Pokémon Company
        president Tsunekazu Ishihara said that they knew Charizard would be
        popular with North Americans, because they like strong, powerful
        characters.
